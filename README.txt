InfiniteScroller is a very simple and lightweight script, created with Javascript, that allows a user to scroll quickly to the bottom of any site that implements infinite scroll. 

//HOW TO USE INFINITE SCROLLER
To use InfiniteScroller, navigate to the site you wish to use it on, simply open the console window (either by right clicking on the site and clicking "Inspect", followed by clicking on "Console" or by using the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-J) and paste in the script from the InfiniteScroller.js file. Click enter and soon you'll be at the bottom of the page!

//USES FOR INFINITE SCROLLER
InfiniteScroller is particularly useful for sites that have a very long scroll length (like the Twitter feed of a passionate user). Scrolling manually to the bottom may seem daunting (or painful for people who suffer from mobility issues)--which is where InfiniteScroller comes into play.
